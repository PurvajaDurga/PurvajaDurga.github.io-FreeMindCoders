<h3 ><u>Type of Numbers</u></h3>
<h3>1.Odd Number :</h3>
<h2>An odd number is a number which is not divisible by 2. The remainder in the case of an odd number is always 1.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 1,3,9 are all odd numbers. </h2>

<h3>2.Even Number :</h3>
<h2>A number which is divisible by 2 and generates a remainder of 0 is called an even number.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 2, 6 and 38 are all even numbers</h2>

<h3>3.Natural numbers :</h3>
<h2>A natural number is an integer greater than 0. Natural numbers begin at 1 and increment to infinity. Natural numbers are also called "counting numbers" because they are used for counting. </h2>
<h2>Ex: 1,2,3 etc.</h2>

<h3>4.Whole number :</h3>
<h2>The whole numbers are the number without fractions and it is a collection of positive integers and zero.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 0,1,2 etc.</h2>

<h3>5.Prime numbers :</h3>
<h2>Prime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors 1 and themselves.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 2,3,7,11...etc.</h2>

<h3>6.Integers numbers :</h3>
<h2>An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 0,10,-2 …etc.</h2>
<br>

<h3><u>Divisibility Rules</u></h3>
<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 2</h3>
<h2>These numbers have only the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the ones place. 
we can say that a number is divisible by 2 if it has any of the digits 0,2,4,6 or 8 in it's ones
place.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 14,46,28..etc.</h2>
<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 3</h3>
<h2>If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 381,85203,928 etc.</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 4</h3>
<h2>A number is divisible by 4, if the number formed by its last two digits (i.e. tens and ones) is divisible by 4.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 348--->48 ia s multiple of 4</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 5</h3>
<h2>The last number is either 0 or 5, the entire number is divisible by 5. </h2>
<h2>Ex: 95--->last number is 5</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 6</h3>
<h2>The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So for a number to be divisible by 6, it must also be divisible by 2 and 3. Therefore, we need to check if a number is even and then check if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 5106--->The last digit is a 6 (it is a multiple of 2 ) and
5 + 1 + 0 + 6 = 12 (12 is a multiple of 3).
</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 7</h3>
<h2>Take the last digit of the number, double it Then subtract the result from the rest of the number If the resulting number is evenly divisible by 7, so is the original number.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 12264-->1226 - 8 = 1218,121 - 16 = 105,10 - 10 = 0. Thus, 12264 is divisible by 7.</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 8</h3>
<h2>A number is divisible by 8 if the numbers formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 895337844-->844 is divisible 8.so,895337844 is divisible by 8.</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 9</h3>
<h2>If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number is divisible by 9.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 51984 is divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits 5+1+9+8+4=27 is divisible by 9.</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 10</h3>
<h2>If the last digit of the number is 0 then the number is divisible by 10.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 890 last digit is 0 so it ie divisible by 10.</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 11</h3>
<h2>Subtract the last digit from a number made by the other digits. If that number is divisible by 11 then the original number is divisible by 11.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 1464 - 1 is 1463;146 - 3 is 143;14 - 3 is 11, which is divisible by 11, so 14641 is divisible by 11.
</h2>

<h3>DIVISIBILITY BY 12</h3>
<h2>A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  The reason this is true is because 12 = 3 × 4.</h2>
<h2>Ex: 648-->6+4+8=18 and 18÷3=6 hence it is divisible by 3.</h2>
